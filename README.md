HotelBookingApp

This is a basic Hotel Booking App. A user can select a range in which the searched hotels should be, and a starting and ending date of the booking. The application will display all the hotels in the
given range and tell whether there are free rooms in the hotel or not. The application was developed for the internshipp application at Siemens. 

The included fetures are:
* the user specifies a radius in kilometers to find all the nearby hotels
* the application lists and displays all hotels found
* the user can select a specific hotel and see all available rooms alongside their prices
* after this, the user can book one, or more of the available rooms
